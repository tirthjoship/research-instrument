   - Otherwise, the previous working day is yesterday.

2. Collect activity:
   - Commits: `git log --oneline --after="<prev_day> 00:00" --before="<today> 00:00" --all`
   - Work in progress: `git status --short` and `git diff --stat HEAD`
   - Current branch: `git branch --show-current`

3. Write a daily summary following the rules below.

## Output rules

- Keep it under ~130 words.
- Show commits as bullet points, then describe any WIP in 1-2 sentences.
- Group related commits where obvious.
- Summary section is 2 sentences max.

## Output format

```
# Daily — <weekday>, <date>
*Previous working day: <prev_day_label>*
*Branch: <current-branch>*

## Done

## In progress
<description of staged/unstaged/untracked changes, or "nothing" if clean>

## Summary
